For distribution and deployment, a module is packaged in a ZIP or JAR file.
While a module JAR file may have any name, by convention the filename
uses the module's URN identifier in dotted form.
For example, if the module's urn is

{literal}urn:org:netkernel:some:module{/literal}

and has a version 1.0.0. The jarred file name will be

{literal}urn.org.netkernel.some.module-1.0.0.jar{/literal}

The use of periods (".") in the filename instead of colons (":") is required as some operating systems
cannot cope with a colon in a filename.
